# Todo List

## Introduction

I started this pet project to learn the basics of PHP. Over time, I came up with ideas to improve it, adding new and interesting features. This project is beneficial for my learning, and it may also be 
useful for others who find this repository and want to explore or use it as an example.

The first version is a simple to-do list.

In the second version, I aim to deepen my knowledge. I will add new features, use libraries, third-party services, and tools. I will also study the basic principles of OOP and other capabilities of the PHP language.

## Version 1.0
A simple todo list application with basic features:
- Add, edit, delete task
- Basic user authentication
- Basic user registration
- Middleware and Validation
- Using and working with sessions

## Version 2.0 (In Development)
An enhanced todo list application with additional features:
- API integration
- Role-based access control
- Notifications
- Creating a user profile, displaying statistics
- Use of libraries 
- And most importantly: delve into the possibilities of the PHP language

## Branches
- `version-1.0`: Stable version with basic features
- `version-2.0`: Development version with new features and improvements
